# MC Quiz Games - Overview

## Signup

Players can signup with email or social media.  Social media is preferred as it provides you with a smoother and safer login experience.
We take the minimum possible amount of data from the social media account - just name and email address.  We will never post on your behalf, and we have no interest in scraping your network!  We hope you'll recommend us instead!
When signing up, after email is verified, you are presented with a statement of how we use your data.  You are able to delete your account at that point, else you can always delete later if needed.  We need to tell you this under GDPR rules.

Finally you are asked to select the country you wish to represent.  This lets you see your overall rank within that country under the Leaderboard (don't worry - this is not public unless you make it to the top 10!)
